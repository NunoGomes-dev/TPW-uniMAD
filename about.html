                        <p>Despite having been recently created,
                            the Research Unit in Media Arts and Design (uniMAD),
                            benefits from the experience of its researchers and shares the goals and circumstances of
                            the school it belongs to. On the one hand, it embraces multiple areas of knowledge, such as
                            Design, Photography, Cinema, Communication and Media, Web Technologies and Digital Arts, and
                            on the other, it profits from the intersection of those same areas, as it turns this
                            research unit into a privileged partner in artistic, research and research/ action projects
                            that require technical, technological, artistic and theoretical know-how.</p>
                        <p> Aware of the
                            reality and demands of contemporary societies, uniMAD understands the urgency of producing
                            and making knowledge available. Such knowledge results from intersecting artistic and
                            technological production and the discourse on these products with broader concerns, which we
                            could refer to as an ecological attitude towards artistic and technological production and
                            promotion. Research is a statement from the institution and its faculty members, both at
                            national and international levels. </p>
                        <p>To this end, it is urgent to stimulate commitment to the
                            local culture and business fabric by involving researchers, promoters and policy makers and
                            raising their awareness about research programs. Achieving some of its objectives will imply
                            promoting an attitude of meticulous participation in the construction of technological and
                            artistic knowledge, supporting policies that result in giving added value to artistic
                            practices as processes of knowledge construction, being involved in the sustainable progress
                            of interactive media and web-based systems, gradually increasing the number of projects and
                            recognizing their added value through funding applications that will ensure their
                            continuation.</p>
